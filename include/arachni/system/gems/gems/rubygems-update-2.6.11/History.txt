=== 2.2.0 / 2013-12-26

Special thanks to Vít Ondruch and Michal Papis for testing and finding bugs in
RubyGems as it was prepared for the 2.2.0 release.

Major enhancements:

* RubyGems can check for gem dependencies files (gem.deps.rb or Gemfile) when
  rubygems executables are started and uses the found dependencies.  This
  means `rake` will work similar to `bundle exec rake`.  To enable this set
  the `RUBYGEMS_GEMDEPS` environment variable to the location of your
  dependencies file.

  See Gem::use_gemdeps for further details.

* A RubyGems directory may now be shared amongst multiple ruby versions.  Upon
  activation RubyGems will automatically compile missing extensions for the
  current platform when the built objects are missing.  Issue #596 by Michal
  Papis

  By default different platforms do not share gem install locations so this
  must be configured by setting GEM_HOME to a common directory.  Some gems use
  fixed paths for requiring extensions and are not compatible with sharing gem
  directories.

  The default sharing location may be configured by RubyGems packagers through
  Gem.default_ext_dir_for.  Pull Request #744 by Vít Ondruch.

Minor enhancements:

* RubyGems checks the 'allowed_push_host' metadata value when pushing a gem to
  prevent an accidental push to a public repository (such as rubygems.org).
  If you have private gems you should set this value in your gem specification
  metadata.  Pull request #603 by Seamus Abshere.
* `gem list` now shows results for multiple arguments.  Pull request #604 by
  Zach Rabinovich.
* `gem pristine --extensions` will restore only gems with extensions.  Issue
  #619 by Postmodern.
* Gem::Specification#files is now sorted.  Pull request #612 by Justin George.
* For `gem list` and friends, "LOCAL" and "REMOTE" headers are omitted if
  only local or remote gem information is requested with --quiet.  Pull
  request #615 by Michal Papis.
* Added Gem::Specification#full_require_paths which is like require_paths, but
  returns a fully-qualified results.  Pull request #632 by Vít Ondruch.
* RubyGems now looks for the https_proxy environment variable for https://
  sources.  RubyGems will fall back to http_proxy if there is no https_proxy.
  Issue #610 by mkristian.
* RubyGems now creates directories in .gem files.  Issue #631 by marksolaris.
* RubyGems raises an exception when a specification includes its gem.  Issue
  #623 by notEthan.
* RubyGems now displays relevant release note information when updating
  RubyGems.  Issue #647 by Trevor Wennblom.
* Deprecated Gem::Installer::ExtensionBuildError in favor of
  Gem::Ext::BuildError.  The old constant is an alias for the new constant.
* When extensions are built the gem_make.out file is always written now, even
  on success.  This will help with debugging bad builds that report success.
* If a specification fails to validate RubyGems shows a link to the
  specification reference guide.  Issue #656 by Markus Heiler.
* When using `gem install -g`, RubyGems now detects the presence of an
  Isolate, Gemfile or gem.deps.rb file.
* Added Gem::StubSpecification#stubbed? to help determine if a user should run
  `gem pristine` to speed up gem loading.  Pull request #694 and #701 by Jon
  Leighton.
* RubyGems now warns when a gem has a pessimistic version dependency that may
  be too strict.
* RubyGems now warns when a gem has an open-ended dependency.
* RubyGems now raises an exception when a dependency for a gem is defined
  twice.
* Marked the license specification attribute as recommended.  Pull request
  #713 by Benjamin Fleischer.
* RubyGems uses io/console instead of `stty` when available.  Pull request
  #740 by Nobuyoshi Nakada
* Relaxed Gem.ruby tests for platforms that override where ruby lives.  Pull
  Request #755 by strzibny.

Bug fixes:

* RubyGems now returns an error status when any file given to `gem which`
  cannot be found.  Ruby bug #9004 by Eugene Vilensky.
* Fixed command escaping when building rake extensions.  Pull request #721 by
  Dmitry Ratnikov.
* Fixed uninstallation of gems when GEM_HOME is a relative directory.  Issue
  #708 by Ryan Davis.
* Default gems are now ignored by Gem::Validator#alien.  Issue #717 by David
  Bahar.
* Fixed typos in RubyGems.  Pull requests #723, #725, #731 by Akira Matsuda,
  pull request #736 by Leo Gallucci, pull request #746 by DV Suresh.
* RubyGems now holds exclusive locks on cached gem files to prevent incorrect
  updates.  Pull Request #737 by Smit Shah
* Improved speed of `gem install --ignore-dependencies`.  Patch by Terence
  Lee.

=== 2.1.11 / 2013-11-12

  communicate with the server.  Issue #688 by Jimmy Dee.
* Allow installation of gems when the home directory does not exist.  Issue
  #689 by Laurence Rowe
* Fix updating gems which have multiple platforms.  Issue #693 by Ookami
  Kenrou.

=== 2.1.6 / 2013-10-08

Bug fixes:

* Added certificates to follow the s3.amazonaws.com certificate change.  Fixes
  #665 by emeyekayee.  Fixes #671 by jonforums.

  Fixes #654 by Vít Ondruch.
* Added test for missing certificates for https://s3.amazonaws.com or
  https://rubygems.org.  Pull request #673 by Hannes Georg.
* RubyGems now allows a Pathname for Kernel#require like the built-in
  Kernel#require.  Pull request #663 by Aaron Patterson.
* Required rbconfig in Gem::ConfigFile for Ruby 1.9.1 compatibility.  (Ruby
  1.9.1 is no longer receiving security fixes, so please update to a newer
  version.)  Issue #676 by Michal Papis.  Issue wayneeseguin/rvm#2262 by
  Thomas Sänger.

=== 2.1.5 / 2013-09-24

Security fixes:

* RubyGems 2.1.4 and earlier are vulnerable to excessive CPU usage due to a
  backtracking in Gem::Version validation.  See CVE-2013-4363 for full details

=== 2.0.0 / 2013-02-24

RubyGems 2.0 includes several new features and many breaking changes.  Some of
these changes will cause existing software to break.  These changes are a
result of improvements to the internals of RubyGems that make it more
maintainable and improve APIs for RubyGems users.

If you are using bundler be sure to install a 1.3.0.prerelease version or
newer.  Older versions of bundler will not work with RubyGems 2.0.

  1.8.23.1 (for Ruby 1.9.3).  Issue #626 by Damir Sharipov.

=== 1.8.23 / 2012-04-19

This release increases the security used when RubyGems is talking to
an https server. If you use a custom RubyGems server over SSL, this
release will cause RubyGems to no longer connect unless your SSL cert
is globally valid.

You can configure SSL certificate usage in RubyGems through the
:ssl_ca_cert and :ssl_verify_mode options in ~/.gemrc and /etc/gemrc.
The recommended way is to set :ssl_ca_cert to the CA certificate for
your server or a certificate bundle containing your CA certification.

You may also set :ssl_verify_mode to 0 to completely disable SSL
certificate checks, but this is not recommended.

=== 1.8.0 / 2011-04-34

This release focused on properly encapsulating functionality.  Most of this
work focused on moving functionality out of Gem::SourceIndex and
Gem::GemPathSearcher into Gem::Specification where it belongs.

After installing RubyGems 1.8.0 you will see deprecations when loading your
exsting gems.  Run `gem pristine --all --no-extensions` to regenerate your
gem specifications safely.

Currently RubyGems does not save the build arguments used to build gems with
extensions.  You will need to run `gem pristine gem_with_extension --
--build-arg` to regenerate a gem with an extension where it requires special
build arguments.

=== 1.4.0 / 2010-12-30

NOTE: In order to better maintain rubygems and to get it in sync with
the world (eg, 1.9's 1.3.7 is different from our 1.3.7), rubygems is
switching to a 4-6 week release schedule. This release is the
precursor to that process and as such may be a bit on the wild side!
You have been warned!

  * Locale-free patch by Yusuke Endoh [ruby-core:17444].

=== 1.2.0 / 2008-06-21

New features:

* RubyGems no longer performs bulk updates and instead only fetches the gemspec
  files it needs.  Alternate sources will need to upgrade to RubyGems 1.2 to
  allow RubyGems to take advantage of the new metadata updater.  If a pre 1.2
  remote source is in the sources list, RubyGems will revert to the bulk update
  code for compatibility.
* RubyGems now has runtime and development dependency types.  Use
  #add_development_dependency and #add_runtime_dependency.  All typeless
  dependencies are considered to be runtime dependencies.
* RubyGems will now require rubygems/defaults/operating_system.rb and
  rubygems/defaults/#{RBX_ENGINE}.rb if they exist.  This allows packagers and
  ruby implementers to add custom behavior to RubyGems via these files.  (If
  the RubyGems API is insufficient, please suggest improvements via the
  RubyGems list.)
* /etc/gemrc (and windows equivalent) for global settings
* setup.rb now handles --vendor and --destdir for packagers

  #20523
* Paths are expanded in more places, bug #19317, bug #19896

* Gem.default_path is now honored if GEM_PATH is not set, patch #19502

Other Changes Include:

* setup.rb
  * stub files created by RubyGems 0.7.x and older are no longer removed.  When
    upgrading from these ancient versions, upgrade to 1.1.x first to clean up
    stubs.
  * RDoc is no longer required until necessary, patch #20414
* `gem server`
  * Now completely matches the output of `gem generate_index` and
    has correct content types
  * Refreshes from source directories for every hit.  The server will no longer
    need to be restarted after installing gems.
* `gem query --details` and friends now display author, homepage, rubyforge url
  and installed location
* `gem install` without -i no longer reinstalls dependencies if they are in
  GEM_PATH but not in GEM_HOME
* Gem::RemoteFetcher now performs persistent connections for HEAD requests,
  bug #7973

=== 1.1.1 / 2008-04-11

Bugs Fixed:

* Gem.prefix now returns non-nil only when RubyGems was installed outside
  sitelibdir or libdir.
* The `gem server` gem list now correctly links to gem details.

=== 1.1.0 / 2008-03-29

New features:

* RubyGems now uses persistent connections on index updates.  Index updates are
  much faster now.
* RubyGems only updates from a latest index by default, cutting candidate gems
  for updates to roughly 1/4 (at present).  Index updates are even faster
  still.
  * `gem list -r` may only show the latest version of a gem, add --all to see
    all gems.
* `gem spec` now extracts specifications from .gem files.
* `gem query --installed` to aid automation of checking for gems.

Bugs Fixed:

=== 0.9.4 / 2007-05-23

If you are experiencing problems with the source index (e.g. strange
"No Method" errors), or problems with zlib (e.g. "Buffer Error"
messsage), we recommend upgrading to RubyGems 0.9.4.

Bug Fixes Include:

* Several people have been experiencing problems with no method errors
  on the source index cache.  The source index cache is now a bit more
  self healing.  Furthermore, if the source index cache is
  irreparable, then it is automatically dropped and reloaded.
* The source cache files may now be dropped with the "gem sources
  --clear-all" command.  (This command may require root is the system
  source cache is in a root protected area).
* Several sub-commands were accidentally dropped from the "gem" command.
  These commands have been restored.

=== 0.9.3 / 2007-05-10

Bug Fixes Include:

The ZLib library on Windows will occasionally complains about a buffer error
when unpacking gems.  The Gems software has a workaround for that problem, but
the workaround was only enabled for versions of ZLib 1.2.1 or earlier.  We
have received several reports of the error occurring with ZLib 1.2.3, so we
have permanently enabled the work around on all versions.

=== 0.9.2 / 2007-02-05

Bug Fixes Include:

* The "unpack" command now works properly.
* User name and password are now passed properly to the authenticating
  proxy when downloading gems.

=== 0.9.1 / 2007-01-16

See ChangeLog

=== 0.9.0 / 2006-06-28

Finally, the much anticipated RubyGems version 0.9.0 is now available.
This release includes a number of new features and bug fixes.  The
number one change is that we can now download the gem index
incrementally.  This will greatly speed up the gem command when only a
few gems are out of date.

Major Enhancments include:

* The gem index is now downloaded incrementally, only updating entries
  that are out of date.  If more than 50 entries are out of date, we
  revert back to a bulk download.
* Several patches related to allowing RubyGems to work with
  authenticating proxies (from Danie Roux and Anatol Pomozov).  Just
  put the user and password in the proxy URL (e.g. -p
  http://user:password@proxy.address.com:8080) or use the
  HTTP_PROXY_USER and HTTP_PROXY_PASS environment variables.
* The gem unpack command can now accept a file path rather than just a
  install gem name.
* Both RI and RDOC documents are now generated by default.
* A gemri command is included to read gem RI docs (only needed for
  Ruby 1.8.4 or earlier).

Minor enhancements include:

* Version 0.0.0 is now a valid gem version.
* Better detection of missing SSL functionality.
* SSL is not required if the security policy does not require
  signature checking.
* Rake built extensions are now supported (Tilman Sauerbeck).
* Several autorequire bug fixes.
* --traceback is now an alias for --backtrace (I can never remember
  which one it is).
* SAFE=1 compatibility fixes.
* .rbw is now a supported suffix for RubyGem's custom require.
* Several Ruby 1.9 compatibility fixes (Eric Hodel).

Bug Fixes:

* Added dashes to gemspecs generated in Ruby 1.8.3.  This solves some
  cross-Ruby version compatibility issues.
* Fixed bug where the wrong executables could be uninstalled (Eric
  Hodel).
* Fixed bug where gem unpack occasionally unpacked the wrong gem.
* Fixed bug where a fatal error occurred when permissions on .gemrc
  were too restrictive (reported by Luca Pireddu).
* Fixed prefix handling for native expressions (patch by Aaron Patterson).
* Fixed several Upgrade => Update typos.

=== 0.8.11 / 2005-07-13

* -y is a synonym for --include-dependencies.
* Better handling of errors in the top level rescue clause.
* Package list command (e.g. gem inspect GEM).
* .gemrc now allows cvsrc-like options to set defaults per subcommand.
* The autorequire gem spec field will now accept a list.
* Substituted Time for Date in specs, increasing performance
  dramatically.
* Fixed reported bug of gem directories ending in "-" (reported by
  Erik Hatcher).
* Fixed but in installer that caused dependency installation to not
  work.
* Added Paul Duncan's gem signing patch.
* Added Mark Hubbart's Framework patch (for better integration with OS
  X).
* Added David Glasser's install-from-mirror patch.
* Additional internal structural cleanup and test reorganization.

=== 0.8.10 / 2005-03-27

* In multi-user environments, it is common to supply multiple versions of gems
  (for example Rails), allowing individual users to select the version of the
  gem they desire.  This allows a user to be insulated from updates to that
  gem.  RubyGems 0.8.10 fixes a problem where gems could occasionally become
  confused about the current versions of libraries selected by the user.
* The other annoying bug is that if there are any existing rubygems-update gems
  installed, then the "gem update --system" command will download a new
  update, but install the latest update prior to the download.

=== 0.8.9

Never released

=== 0.8.8 / 2005-03-14

* Moved the master definition of class Requirement back under version.
  Kept the body of Requirement under Gem.

=== 0.8.7 / 2005-03-14

Even though it has only been a few weeks since that last release,
there are quite a number of new features in 0.8.7.  A complete list of
new features will be given below, but here is a summary of the hot
items.

* The bug that prevented some users from installing rails has been
  squashed.  A big thanks to Bill Guindon (aGorilla) for helping track
  that one down.

There are several new commands available on the gem command:

* gem cleanup GEMNAME -- Cleanup (uninstall) all the old versions of
  gem.  If the gem name is omitted, the entire repository is cleaned.
* gem dependency GEMNAME -- Show the dependencies for the named gems.
  This is really helpful when trying to figure out what gem needs what
  other gem.

There changes to the existing commands as well.

* gem uninstall is much smarter about removing gems from the
  repository.  Lists of gems are now uninstalled in proper dependency
  order (ie. if A depends on B, A is uninstalled first).  Also,
  warnings about broken dependencies occur only when removing the
  *last* gem that supports a dependency is removed.

Both gem install and gem uninstall support some new command line
options that can reduce the amount of yes/no queries given the user.
For install we have:

* --ignore-dependencies -- Only install requests gems, no
  dependendecies are automatically installed.
* --include-dependencies -- Automatically install dependencies,
  without confirmation.

For gem uninstall, the new options are:

* --all -- Uninstall all matching gems without confirmation.
* --ignore-dependencies -- Uninstall, even if dependencies are broken.
* --executables -- Remove executables without confirmation

Under general cleanup, gems will not, by default, run RDoc on packages
that do not have the RDoc flag set.

And finally there is a new library file 'gemconfigure' to aid in
writing version sensitive applications (without undue dependencies on
RubyGems); and 'gemwhich', a short script to locate libraries in the
file system.  You can read more about them here:

* gemconfigure: http://docs.rubygems.org/read/chapter/4#page73
* gemwhich: http://docs.rubygems.org/read/chapter/17

=== 0.8.6 / 2005-02-27

* Fixed a small bug with shebang construction

=== 0.8.5 / 2005-02-26

Do you know how you used to dread getting the following message while
installing gems?

  Updating Gem source index for: http://gems.rubyforge.org

It could take up to 30 seconds (on my machine, even worse on others) for
that crazy source index to update.

This latest release of RubyGems speeds that wait time up considerably.
The following table gives the following times for installing RedCloth
with a required source index update on three system we had available to
us.  No RDoc generation was included in the following times.

  RubyGems    Linux         Mac OSX      Windows
  0.8.4       33 secs       73 secs      58 secs
  0.8.5        8 secs       14 secs      21 secs

The new caching code is at least 3x faster than previous versions.  Woo
Hoo!

=== 0.8.4 / 2005-01-01

* Rubygems 0.8.3's installer was broken unless you already had an older
  version of RubyGems installed.  That's fixed.
* Change in the way Gem::Specification internally deals with lazy attributes
  and defaults, bringing (with some loadpath_manager changes) a fairly
  significant increase in speed.
* Support for lower-cased Gem file names (for you, Paul Duncan :)
* Erik Veenstra's patch for making Gem versions sortable.

=== 0.8.3 / 2004-12-07

No real earth shattering news here, but there were a number of really
annoying issues involving other libraries that RubyGems depends upon.
0.8.3 contains some workarounds for these issues.  In particular:

* Added workaround for the null byte in Dir string issue. (see
  http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/121702).
  (Thanks to Mauricio Fernández for the quick response on this one).
* Added workaround for old version of Zlib on windows that caused
  Ruwiki to fail to install. (see
  http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/121770)
* Added workaround for large YAML file issues.  (We dynamically cut
  down the size of the source index YAML file and seem to have worked
  around immediate issues.

There has been some minor usability enhancements and changes ...

* A user specific source index cache can be used when the site-wide
  cache is unwritable (i.e. because you are running as a non-admin).
  This *greatly* speeds up gem commands run in non-admin mode when the
  site-wide cache is out of date.
* The gem command now used an HTTP HEAD command to detect if the
  server's source index needs to be downloaed.
* gem check gemname --test will run unit tests on installed gems that
  have unit tests.
* Multiple gem names are allowed on the gem install command line.
  This means you can do:

    gem install rake rails needle postgres-pr pimki

  (Ok, you get the idea)
* Multiple authors my be specified in a Gem spec.
* Switched to using setup.rb (rather than a custom install script) for
  the installation of RubyGems itself.  If you have installed RubyGems
  before, double check the installation instructions and make sure you
  use setup.rb instead of install.rb.
* Ryan Davis has provided a patch so you can use an env variable
  (GEM_SKIP), to tell loadpath_manager not to load gems of those
  names.  This was useful for him while testing libs that he had in
  development.

=== 0.8.1 / 2004-09-17

* Quick release to capture some bug fixes.

=== 0.8.0 / 2004-09-15

* Remove need for library stubs.  Set the RUBYOPT environment variable to
  include "rrubygems", and a normal require will find gem files.  Continue to
  use 'require_gem gem_name, version' to specify gem versions.
* Deprecated "test_suite_file" gemspec attribute in favor of "test_files" array.
* Generates rdoc by default on installs.
* Adopted tar/gzip file format, thanks to Mauricio Fernandez.
* "gem rdoc" allows generation of rdoc after gem installation (will add a "gem
  test"
* Application stubs can now accept an optional parameter of _VERSION_ that will
  run an arbitrary version of the application requested.
* Various bug fixes
* Various platform-independency improvements
* "gem spec --all" displays spec info for all installed version of a given gem.
* Dynamic caching of sources
* Support for user-definable sources on the command line (thanks Assaph Mehr)
* More intelligent support for platform-dependent gems.  Use Platform::CURRENT
  when building a gem to set its platform to the one you're building on.
  Installation displays a choice of platform-dependent gems, allowing the user
  to pick.
* Added "gem unpack" for "unpacking" a gem to the current directory

=== 0.7.0 / 2004-07-09

See ChangeLog

=== 0.6.1 / 2004-06-08

See ChangeLog

=== 0.6.0 / 2004-06-08

* Collapse output of --search and --list (and gem_server) operations so that
  each gem is listed only once, with each of its versions listed on the same
  line.
* bin/gem: new --upgrade-all option allows one to upgrade every installed gem
* new #required_ruby_version attribute added to gem specification for
  specifying a dependency on which version of ruby the gem needs.  Format it
  accepts is the same as the Gem::Version::Requirement format:

    spec.required_ruby_version = "> 1.8.0"
* --install-stub defaults to true, so library stubs are created

=== 0.5.0 / 2004-06-06

* Jim added the ability to specify version constraints to avoid API
  incompatibilities.  This has been the subject of much debate for the past
  couple of months, with many ideas and code contributed by Eivind Eklund and
  Mauricio Fernandez.  The following set of assertions shows how it works:

    assert_inadequate("1.3", "~> 1.4")
    assert_adequate(  "1.4", "~> 1.4")
    assert_adequate(  "1.5", "~> 1.4")
    assert_inadequate("2.0", "~> 1.4") # This one is key--the new operator
				       # disallows major version number
				       # differences.
* Group gem search output when multiple versions exist for a given gem:

    activerecord (0.7.8, 0.7.7, 0.7.6, 0.7.5)
      Implements the ActiveRecord pattern for ORM.
* Add arbitrary RDoc-able files via gemspec (not just Ruby source files) for
  people who have, for example, README.rdoc in their distributions.  Add to
  gemspec via: spec.extra_rdoc_files = ["list", "of", "files"].  Ruby files are
  automatically included.
* Some small bug fixes

=== 0.4.0 / 2004-05-30

* Minor bug fixes including Windows compatibility issues

=== 0.3.0 / 2004-04-30

* Cleanup of command-line arguments and handling.  Most commands accept a
  --local or --remote modifier.
* Creation of Application Gems (packages that include executable programs).
  See http://rubygems.rubyforge.org/wiki/wiki.pl?DeveloperGuide for information
  on how to use it.
* Basic functionality for installing binary gems from source (:extensions
  property of gem specification holds an array of paths to extconf.rb files to
  be used for compilation)
* Install library "stub" allowing a normal 'require' to work (which then does
  the rubygems require and 'require_gem'
* --run-tests runs the test suite specified by the "test_suite_file" property
  of a gem specification
* HTTP Proxy support works.  Rewrite of HTTP code.
* Unit and functional tests added (see Rakefile).
* Prompt before remote-installing dependencies during gem installation.
* Config file for storing preferences for 'gem' command usage.
* Generally improved error messages (still more work to do)
* Rearranged gem directory structure for cleanliness.

=== 0.2.0 / 2004-03-14

* Initial public release
